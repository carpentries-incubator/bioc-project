## Bioconductor and CRAN

[Bioconductor][bioc-website] and [CRAN][cran-website] are two well-established repositories of R packages that are often compared in terms on practices with regard to package submission, review, and release cycles.

R packages can be installed from a number of repositories online.
Repositories often have different guidelines and procedures to manage and check the quality of packages that are distributed on their platforms.
This can be a source of great confusion for users, when searching for package and assessing their popularity and reliability before using them.

CRAN tends to host more general-purpose R packages, hosting more than 17,854 packages (July 2021; [source][cran-packages]).

Bioconductor instead focuses on R packages related to bioinformatics tasks and workflows.
Biocondutor distinguishes packages from different types, including 2,042 software packages, 406 experiment data packages, 965 annotation packages, and 29 workflows (July 2021; [source][bioc-packages]).
