## A scientific project

The original publication describes the aims and methods of the project at its inception `r Citet(bib, "Gentleman2004")`.


## A package repository

[BiocViews][biocviews-software] are a predefined - and evolving - set of labels used to categorize all the packages available in the Bioconductor project.


## A support site

The Bioconductor [support site][bioc-support-site] provides a platform where users and developers can communicate freely (following the Bioconductor [Code of Conduct][bioc-code-of-conduct]) to discuss issues on a range of subjects, ranging from packages to conceptual questions about best practices.

## A Slack workspace

The Bioconductor [Slack workspace][bioc-slack] is an open space that all community members are welcome to join (for free) and use for rapid interactions.
Currently, the "Pro" pricing plan kindly supported by core funding provides:

- Unlimited message archive
- Unlimited apps
- Group video calls with screen sharing
- Work securely with other organizations using Slack Connect

A wide range of channels have been created to discuss a range of subjects, and community members can freely join the discussion on those channels of create new ones to discuss new subjects.

Important announcements are posted on the `#general` channel.

> ## Note
>
> Users are encouraged to use the Bioconductor [support site][bioc-support-site] to raise issues that relevant to the wider community.
> The Slack workspace is often most useful for live discussions, and widely subscribed channels (e.g. `#general`) should be used with moderation.

## A mailing list for developers

The <bioc-devel@r-project.org> mailing list is used for communication between package developers, and announcements from the Biocondutor core team.


## Conferences, courses and workshops

The Bioconductor community regularly organizes a number of events throughout the year and across the world.
For example:

- The annual BioC summer conference in North America
- Regional conference in winter (e.g. BioC Europe, BioC Asia)
- Summer schools (e.g., CSAMA)
- Online meetings open to all community members (e.g., Bioconductor Developers Forum)

[Course materials][bioc-course-materials] are regularly uploaded on the Bioconductor website following each of those events.
